# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Lee

I'm a Data Science Master's student at [Harvard SEAS](https://seas.harvard.edu/), passionate about building real-world ML applications with clean engineering and measurable impact.

- 🔭 Currently building: an MLOps-enabled crane detection app using YOLOv5 + SAHI
- 💻 Learning: cloud MLOps (AWS, Docker, CI/CD), Modern NLP with Transformers
- 📈 Interests: ML modeling, NLP, applied stats, deployment pipelines
- 📫 Reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leeanddrew/) | [Portfolio](https://leeanddrew.github.io)
- 🧠 Fun fact: I play the guitar 🎸

### 📌 Featured Projects

- 🕊️ **[Sandhill Crane Detector](https://github.com/leeanddrew/ai-counting-cranes)**  
  Object detection pipeline using YOLOv5 + SAHI to identify and count Sandhill Cranes in aerial thermal imagery.  
  Deployed with Streamlit and Docker, integrating MLOps best practices.

- 🌍 **[World Happiness Visualizations](https://github.com/leeanddrew/world-happiness-visualization)**  
  Interactive dashboards and regression analysis on global well-being metrics (2015–2022) using Tableau, Plotly, and Python.  
  Includes a case study on South Korea’s suicide rate.

- 🔥 **[Spatiotemporal Analysis of Wildfire Response](https://github.com/leeanddrew/google_wildfire)**  
  Trained on Google Trends data and spatiotemporal features from 12 U.S. DMA regions.

- 🚀 **[Hypersonic STLE Prediction](https://github.com/leeanddrew/ml-for-hypersonic)**  
  Supervised and deep learning models to predict shock-induced transition locations in hypersonic vehicles.  
  Used sparse pressure sensor data and engineered time-series features to improve R² from 0.79 to 0.89.
